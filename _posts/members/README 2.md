### Team member bios

The team member bios follow the standard blog posts.

At the bottom of the file there should be the `relative_include` statement, providing the name of the publicstions file in markdown format:
`{% include_relative pubs/xxxxxPubs.markdown %}`
where `xxxxx` is the last name of the team member.

The file `pubs/xxxxxPubs.markdown` can be produced from a bibtex file using the scripts in `_data/`
Please see `_data/README.md`
