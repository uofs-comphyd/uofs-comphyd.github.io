### Short Bio
Marysa Laguë is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Saskatchewan at Canmore. Her research focuses on how changes in the land surface, such as changes in vegetation, can drive changes in the both the local atmosphere and the large-scale climate by modulating fluxes of water and energy between the land and the atmosphere. She uses models of varied complexity to study where the atmosphere is most sensitive to changes in the land, what land surface properties the atmosphere responds most strongly to, and how atmospheric responses to land surface change can feed back on climate both locally and remotely. In addition to her main line of research, Marysa has collaborated with scientists around the world to explore topics including paleo-climate, ecology, and exoplanets.

### Models
The Simple Land Interface Model (SLIM) is an idealized land surface model that can be run coupled to the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Source code and instructions for running SLIM can be found on my github page [here](https://github.com/marysa/SimpleLand).
