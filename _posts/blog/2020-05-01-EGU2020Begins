The [computational hydrology](https://uofs-comphyd.github.io/) group is now pretty much in full swing. Most of the [team](https://uofs-comphyd.github.io/team/) is assembled and engaged in continental-domain hydrological modelling and forecasting, with a focus on advancing prediction capabilities over North America.

[Martyn Clark](https://uofs-comphyd.github.io/current_member/martyn_clark) is active in several areas of computational hydrology. His research focuses on large-domain hydrological modelling.

[Guoqiang Tang](https://uofs-comphyd.github.io/current_member/guoqiang_tang) is developing a probabilistic spatial meteorological dataset for North America in order to characterize uncertainties in spatially distributed hydrological model forcings. His research extends previous work by [Clark and Slater (2006)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JHM474.1) and [Newman et al. (2015)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JHM-D-15-0026.1) to condition station-based estimates on reanalysis and satellite data.

[Wouter Knoben](https://uofs-comphyd.github.io/current_member/wouter_knoben) is developing a comprehensive model-agnostic benchmarking system for North America in order to understand model weaknesses and identify priorities for future model development. Wouter’s current work is configuring the SUMMA model ([Clark et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015WR017198)) for the North American domain in order to provide initial capabilities for continental-domain modelling and to evaluate alternative modelling approaches.

[Christian Hart](https://uofs-comphyd.github.io/current_member/christian_hart) is a research assistant focused on developing model test cases for operational monitoring networks. Christian’s initial work is to configure and evaluate SUMMA for the [SnoTEL network](https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/).

[Shervan Gharari](https://uofs-comphyd.github.io/current_member/shervan_gharari) is focused on incorporating lakes and reservoirs in our continental-domain network-based routing model mizuRoute ([Mizukami et al., 2016](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/2223/2016/)). Shervan's work is part of a larger collaboration with [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu/) to improve river routing in Earth System models and bring in often neglected human dimension in modelling of hydrological cycle.

[Louise Arnal](https://uofs-comphyd.github.io/current_member/louise_arnal) has recently joined us after completing a PhD at the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk/) and [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/). Louise is focused on ensemble streamflow prediction, starting with advancing understanding of the sources of predictability in subseasonal-to-seasonal streamflow forecasts across North America. Louise is also advancing [science engagement through the fusion of science and art](https://sciartfloods.wordpress.com/).

[Reza Zolfaghari](https://uofs-comphyd.github.io/current_member/reza_zolfaghari) also recently joined us, having recently completed his PhD at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/). Reza is working on improving the numerical implementation of the SUMMA model ([Clark et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015WR017198)), advancing both efficiency and accuracy/robustness through the use of alternative numerical solvers. Reza has a joint appointment with [Ray Spiteri](https://www.cs.usask.ca/~spiteri/) in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.usask.ca/) at the [University of Saskatchewan](https://www.usask.ca/).

[Jim Freer](https://uofs-comphyd.github.io/current_member/jim_freer) is a Visiting Professor from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), having just started his two-year stint at the Coldwater Lab. Jim is engaged in most of our research thrusts in [computational hydrology](https://uofs-comphyd.github.io/), with his personal research focused on quantifying uncertainty in streamflow data.

All of our work is made possible by the efforts of [Joy Mitsogianni](https://uofs-comphyd.github.io/current_member/joy_mitsogianni). Joy provides us all with excellent support to keep things running smoothly.

While the team is mostly in place, we do have a couple of openings for students and postdoctoral scholars. Please contact [Martyn Clark](https://uofs-comphyd.github.io/current_member/martyn_clark) if you are interested in joining our team!
