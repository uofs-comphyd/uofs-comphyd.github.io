Last year we had a wonderful session at the [EGU 2019](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/session/30338). As lead convener, I was working closely with my colleagues Björn, Luis, Simon and Sina to organize more than 50 abstracts and 3 oral blocks. We had thought-provoking contributions from catchment to global hydrology. From remote sensing to field observation. A wide range of expertise and opinion.

This year however, things are a bit different. We are depending on a text-based system to present and convene. I was thinking to myself; "who will participate?!". But it turns out that there are much more enthusiastic scientists that I initially anticipated.

This year, we move on to convene our [session](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/session/35498) while sitting in totally different time zones. For the good memories, I keep looking at this picture from EGU 2019. Hope everyone in this picture is safe and happy. And sincerely hope to make another photo like this next year.
