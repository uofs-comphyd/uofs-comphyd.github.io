I"Ê<p>As we enter our third month of social distancing, it is nice to remember the wonderful international visitors to the lab over the past year. The Coldwater Lab is normally a buzzing hub of activity.  Being close to a major international airport (Calgary), we have plenty of interaction between those who work at the lab and those fortunate enough to visit us for a while. In these times of social distancing and limited travel, we look back on the illustrious visitors to the lab in the past 9 months or so.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.smhi.se/en/research/research-departments/hydrology/berit-arheimer-1.8007">Berit Arheimer</a>, who is currently head of the Unit for Hydrological Research at SMHI (Sweden) and president-elect of the IAHS, visited the lab in July 2019 to explore potential collaborations.</p>

<p>Autumn 2019 saw a string of visitors in quick succession. <a href="https://www.ce.washington.edu/facultyfinder/bart-nijssen">Bart Nijssen</a> (Univeristy of Washington, USA), <a href="https://www.unr.edu/nres/people/harpold-adrian">Adrian Harpold</a> (University of Nevada, USA) and <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/hannah-david.aspx">David Hannah</a> (University of Birmingham, UK) all visited Canada as part of the <a href="https://water.usask.ca/lecture-series/dls.php#2019DistinguishedLectureSeries">University of Saskatchewan Global Institute for Water Security Distinguished Lecture Series</a> and found time to visit Canmore for a few days as well.</p>

<p>We got to welcome three early career researchers for longer stays, two of which during autumn. <a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/99684-keirnan-fowler">Keirnan Fowler</a> (University of Melbourne, Australia) visited for two weeks to initiate collaboration on model benchmarking. PhD candidate <a href="https://twitter.com/LiinaStein">Lina Stein</a> (University of Bristol, UK) joined us for a three-month research visit to investigate flood generating processes in North America. Lina‚Äôs supervisor <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/ross-a-woods/overview.html">Ross Woods</a> (University of Bristol, UK) visited us for a week during Lina‚Äôs research visit.</p>

<p>January 2020 saw few visitors, presumably because Alberta had the honor of being one of the coldest places on the planet for a while. Things picked back up in February when <a href="https://twitter.com/manuelaibrunner?lang=en">Manuela Brunner</a> (National Center for Atmospheric Research, US) joined us for a three week visit to share thoughts on dominant flood generating processes and the capabilities of current hydrologic models to represent these. Around the same time, <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/dmitri.kavetski">Dmitri Kavetski</a> (University of Adelaide, Australia) included Canmore as one of the stops on his research tour.</p>

<p>In early February, Canmore was also the home of a Global Water Futures: Core Modelling Geospatial Intelligence meeting that brought together two dozen research personnel to discuss ways to improve model workflows and code sharing, large-domain parameter estimation and model benchmarking efforts across GWF. <a href="https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=38094">Luis Samaneigo</a> (University of Leipzig, Germany) was the plenary speaker at this meeting, where he shared his insights on multiscale parameter regionalization.</p>

<p>We saw our last visitors in early March, when <a href="https://staff.ucar.edu/users/andywood">Andy Wood</a> and <a href="https://staff.ucar.edu/users/mizukami">Naoki Mizukami</a> (NCAR, US) visited us for several days of intense discussions. This visit advances Martyn‚Äôs work with Naoki in developing version 2 of the mizuRoute routing model, expanding the team to include our team member Shervan Gharari to incorporate lakes and reservoirs in mizuRoute.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre all looking forward to transitioning to the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù and future interactions with the international science community, in whatever form these interactions may take! Stay safe everyone!</p>
