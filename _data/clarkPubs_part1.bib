	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/43944886},
	abstract = {Daily rainfall data from about 200 automatic weather stations are operationally interpolated onto a regular grid of points covering all of New Zealand at a resolution of 0.05 degrees lat/long (approximately 5 km). These data, as well as daily values for 10 other climate variables, are known as NIWAs Virtual Climate Station (VCS) data. There is a need to understand the accuracy of the daily rainfall estimates, particularly for hydrological assessments. The provision of historic daily rainfall data from more than 700 Regional Council locations (many of which are no longer operational) not used in the generation of the VCS estimates, has enabled a robust error assessment. Using a regression model approach (where the VCS rainfall is the independent variable and the Regional Council rainfall is the dependent variable), bias corrections were determined and applied to every VCS daily rainfall {\textgreater} 1 mm. The bias-corrected VCS rainfall mean absolute error for locations below about 500 m elevation is approximately 2-4 mm (95\% of the range) when rain days only (VCS rainfall ≥ 1 mm) are analysed. The error (and its spatial variation) is higher in areas above 500 m elevation, at approximately 5-15 mm. For daily VCS rainfalls {\textgreater} 40 mm (heavy rain days), the errors are approximately 8-12 mm (low elevation areas) and 10-40 mm (high elevation areas), and for monthly rainfall totals the corresponding errors are approximately 10-15 mm and 10-120 mm. For some uses of daily rainfall data, the installation of good quality telemetered rain gauges is the only option. However, if gauges can't be installed or the data collection cannot be maintained long-term, then using the bias-corrected VCS rainfall data is a viable option that is often a significant improvement over using data from distant stations that may not be in the same catchment or even located in a similar climatic zone.},

	abstract = {To improve the performance of forecasting models, real-time data can be assimilated to update the model states for each new forecast. This paper reports on a non-statistical way to update the groundwater state of rainfall runoff models based on TOPMODEL concepts. The updating procedure uses measured flows and an analytical relationship between water table position and baseflow. To apply the procedure it is desirable to define periods when there is no surface runoff to the stream network. An innovative and effective model-based way to define these periods is described. By assimilating measured flow data into a TopNet flood forecasting model, the forecasts of both high and low flows are improved, with the changes in water table position being consistent with the corrections to the forecast hydrograph.},

	abstract = {Land models are increasingly used and preferred in terrestrial hydrological prediction applications. One reason for selecting land models over simpler models is that their physically based backbone enables wider application under different conditions. This study evaluates the temporal variability in streamflow simulations in land models. Specifically, we evaluate how the subsurface structure and model parameters control the partitioning of water into different flow paths and the temporal variability in streamflow. Moreover, we use a suite of model diagnostics, typically not used in the land modeling community to clarify model weaknesses and identify a path toward model improvement. Our analyses show that the typical land model structure, and their functions for moisture movement between soil layers (an approximation of Richards equation), has a distinctive signature where flashy runoff is superimposed on slow recessions. This hampers the application of land models in simulating flashier basins and headwater catchments where floods are generated. We demonstrate the added value of the preferential flow in the model simulation by including macropores in both a toy model and the Variable Infiltration Capacity model. We argue that including preferential flow in land models is essential to enable their use for multiple applications across a myriad of temporal and spatial scales.},

local- and global-scale modelling. A further objective of ESM-SnowMIP is to
better quantify snow-related feedbacks in the Earth system. Although it is
not part of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP6), ESM-SnowMIP is tightly linked to the CMIP6-endorsed Land Surface,
