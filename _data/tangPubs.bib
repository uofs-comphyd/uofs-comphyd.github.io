	abstract = {Low accuracy and coarse spatial resolution are the two main drawbacks of satellite precipitation products. Therefore, calibration and downscaling are necessary before these products are applied. This study proposes a two-step framework to improve the accuracy of satellite precipitation estimates. The first step is data merging based on optimum interpolation (OI), and the second step is downscaling based on geographically weighted regression (GWR); therefore, the framework is called OI-GWR. An Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) (IMERG) product is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of OI-GWR in the Tianshan Mountains, China. First, the original IMERG precipitation data (OIMERG) are merged with rain gauge data using the OI method to produce corrected IMERG precipitation data (CIMERG). Then, using CIMERG as the first guess and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as the auxiliary variable, GWR is utilized for spatial downscaling. The two-step OI-GWR method is compared with several traditional methods, including GWR downscaling (Ori\_GWR) and spline interpolation. The cross-validation results show that (1) the OI method noticeably improves the accuracy of OIMERG, and (2) the 1-km downscaled data obtained using OI-GWR are much better than those obtained from Ori\_GWR, spline interpolation, and OIMERG. The proposed OI-GWR method can contribute to the development of high-resolution and high-accuracy regional precipitation datasets. However, it should be noted that the method proposed in this study cannot be applied in regions without any meteorological stations. In addition, further efforts will be needed to achieve daily- or hourly-scale downscaling of precipitation.},

	abstract = {Two satellite precipitation products (3B42RT and 3B42V7) of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) show systematic overestimation anomalies over inland water bodies in high mountain Asia (HMA). The relative difference (RD) was calculated between precipitation estimates over pixels containing water bodies and over pixels neighboring water bodies. A t-test was employed to check the statistical significance. Results show that similar to 53\% of the water bodies passed the significance test at the daily scale for the TRMM products on average. Gauge adjustment alleviates the overestimation of 3B42V7 (mean RD = 20\%) compared with 3B42RT (mean RD = 34\%). Liquid water surfaces tend to affect the quality of TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis more significantly than ice water surfaces due to different passive microwave (MW) emission characteristics. In contrast, Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission products provide more consistent precipitation estimates, with only similar to 4\% of the water bodies passing the significance test. TRMM-based precipitation estimates are much higher than GPM products over inland water bodies, which is, however, not the case over the land. The improvement is mainly attributed to the unified and updated MW algorithm used in GPM products.},

	abstract = {The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) produces the latest generation of satellite precipitation estimates and has been widely used since its release in 2014. IMERG V06 provides global rainfall and snowfall data beginning from 2000. This study comprehensively analyzes the quality of the IMERG product at daily and hourly scales in China from 2000 to 2018 with special attention paid to snowfall estimates. The performance of IMERG is compared with nine satellite and reanalysis products (TRMM 3B42, CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, GSMaP, CHIRPS, SM2RAIN, ERA5, ERA-Interim, and MERRA2). Results show that the IMERG product outperforms other datasets, except the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), which uses daily-scale station data to adjust satellite precipitation estimates. The monthly-scale station data adjustment used by IMERG naturally has a limited impact on estimates of precipitation occurrence and intensity at the daily and hourly time scales. The quality of IMERG has improved over time, attributed to the increasing number of passive microwave samples. SM2RAIN, ERA5, and MERRA2 also exhibit increasing accuracy with time that may cause variable performance in climatological studies. Even relying on monthly station data adjustments, IMERG shows good performance in both accuracy metrics at hourly time scales and the representation of diurnal cycles. In contrast, although ERA5 is acceptable at the daily scale, it degrades at the hourly scale due to the limitation in reproducing the peak time, magnitude and variation of diurnal cycles. IMERG underestimates snowfall compared with gauge and reanalysis data. The triple collocation analysis suggests that IMERG snowfall is worse than reanalysis and gauge data, which partly results in the degraded quality of IMERG in cold climates. This study demonstrates new findings on the uncertainties of various precipitation products and identifies potential directions for algorithm improvement. The results of this study will be useful for both developers and users of satellite rainfall products.},

	abstract = {Precipitation is one of the most important components in the water and energy cycles. Radars are considered the best available technology for observing the spatial distribution of precipitation either from the ground since the 1980s or from space since 1998. This study, for the first time ever, compares and evaluates the only three existing spaceborne precipitation radars, i.e., the Ku-band precipitation radar (PR), the W-band Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR), and the Ku/Ka-band Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). The three radars are matched up globally and intercompared in the only period which they coexist: 2014-2015. In addition, for the first time ever, TRMM PR and GPM DPR are evaluated against hourly rain gauge data in Mainland China. Results show that DPR and PR agree with each other and correlate very well with gauges in Mainland China. However, both show limited performance in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) known as the Earth's third pole. DPR improves light precipitation detectability, when compared with PR, whereas CPR performs best for light precipitation and snowfall. DPR snowfall has the advantage of higher sampling rates than CPR; however, its accuracy needs to be improved further. The future development of spaceborne radars is also discussed in two complementary categories: (1) multifrequency radar instruments on a single platform and (2) constellations of many small cube radar satellites, for improving global precipitation estimation. This comprehensive intercomparison of PR, CPR, and DPR sheds light on spaceborne radar precipitation retrieval and future radar design.},

We find that (1) FY-2G QPE and Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) perform significantly better than FY-2E QPE, using rain gauge data, with correlation coefficients (CC) varying from 0.65 to 0.90, 0.80 to 0.90, and 0.40 to 0.53, respectively; (2) IMERG agrees well with rain gauge data at monthly scale, while it performs worse than FY-2G QPE at hourly and daily scales, which may be caused by its algorithms; (3) FY-2G QPE underestimates the precipitation in summer, while FY-2E QPE and IMERG generally overestimate the precipitation; (4) there is an interesting error phenomenon in that both FY-based and GPM-based precipitation products perform more poorly during the period from 06:00 to 10:00 UTC than other periods at diurnal scale; and (5) FY-2G QPE agrees well with IMERG in terms of spatial patterns and consistency (CC of {\textasciitilde}0.81).

All water cycle variables on the Earth are closely interconnected with each other through the process of energy and water circulation. Observing, understanding and predicting the storage, movement, and quality of water remains a grand challenge for contemporary water science and technology, especially for researches across different spatio-temporal scales. The remote sensing observing platform has a unique advantage in acquiring complex water information and has already greatly improved observing, understanding, and predicting ability of the water cycle. Methods of obtaining comprehensive water cycle data are also expanded by new remote sensing techniques, and the vast amount of data has become increasingly available and thus accelerated a new Era: the Remote Sensing Big Data Study of Global Water Cycle. The element inversion, time and space reconstruction, and scale conversion are three key scientific issues for remote sensing water cycle in such Era. Moreover, it also presents a huge opportunity of capitalizing the combinations of Remote Sensing and Big Data to advance and improve the global hydrology and water security research and development, and uncork the new bottlenecks.},

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing is able to provide information on global rain and snow, but challenges remain in accurate estimation of precipitation rates, particularly in snow retrieval. In this work, the deep neural network (DNN) is applied to estimate rain and snow rates in high latitudes. The reference data for DNN training are provided by two spaceborne radars onboard the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory and CloudSat. Passive microwave data from the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI), infrared data from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and environmental data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts are trained to the spaceborne radar-based reference precipitation. The DNN estimates are compared to data from the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF), which is used to retrieve passive microwave precipitation for the GPM mission. First, the DNN-based retrieval method performs well in both training and testing periods. Second, the DNN can reveal the advantages and disadvantages of different channels of GMI and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Additionally, infrared and environmental data can improve precipitation estimation of the DNN, particularly for snowfall. Finally, based on the optimized DNN, rain and snow are estimated in 2017 from orbital GMI brightness temperatures and compared to ERA-Interim and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 reanalysis data. Evaluation results show that (1) the DNN can largely mitigate the underestimation of precipitation rates in high latitudes by GPROF; (2) the DNN-based snowfall estimates largely outperform those of GPROF; and (3) the spatial distributions of DNN-based precipitation are closer to reanalysis data. The method and assessment presented in this study could potentially contribute to the substantial improvement of satellite precipitation products in high latitudes.
Plain Language Summary Snow has a significant influence on the hydrological cycle and water resource availability. Compared to ground gauges and radars with limited coverage, satellite remote sensing can provide global rain and snow observations from space. However, traditional satellite precipitation retrieval methods are prone to errors in snow estimation at high latitudes. In this study, we developed a new rain and snow estimation method at high latitudes using deep neural networks. The reference data sets were from two spaceborne radars that provide the most direct precipitation observations from space. Passive microwave, infrared, and environmental data were trained to the reference data sets for rain and snow estimation. Results show that the neural network-based method can largely reduce the underestimation of rain and snow rates in high latitudes in many prior algorithms. Statistical indices for snow estimation are notably improved. Furthermore, combining data from passive microwave, infrared, and environmental data sets contribute to better precipitation estimation than a single source. We suggest that deep neural networks could potentially contribute to the improvement of satellite precipitation at high latitudes, which is valuable for expanding the spatial coverage of current satellite products.},

The results reveal that: (a) the consistency of cross-examination results against traditional metrics approves the applicability of MTC in extreme events; (b) the consistency of cross-events of MTC evaluation results also suggests its robustness across individual storms; (c) all products demonstrate their capacity of capturing the spatial and temporal variability of the storm structures while also magnifying respective inherent deficiencies; (d) NCEP and IMERG likely underestimate while MRMS overestimates the storm total accumulation, especially for the 500-year return Hurricane Harvey; (e) both NCEP and IMERG underestimate extreme rainrates (\&gt;= 90 mm/h) likely due to device insensitivity or saturation while MRMS maintains robust across the rainrate range; (g) all three show inherent deficiencies in capturing the storm core of Harvey possibly due to device malfunctions with the NCEP gauges, relative low spatiotemporal resolution of IMERG, and the unusual \&ldquo;hot\&rdquo; MRMS radar signals. Given the unknown ground reference assumption of MTC, this study suggests that MRMS has the best overall performance. The similarities, differences, advantages, and deficiencies revealed in this study could guide the users for emergency response and motivate the community not only to improve the respective sensor/algorithm but also innovate multidata merging methods for one best possible product, specifically suitable for extreme storm events.},

	abstract = {The relative effect of climate change and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is essential not only for understanding the hydrological mechanism over Jiangxi province in China but also for local water resources management as well as flood control. This study quantitatively researched in-depth information on climate change in Jiangxi using the up-to-date “ground truth” precipitation and temperature data, the Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE, 1961–2015, 0.25°) data; analyzed the connections between ENSO and climate factors (including precipitation and temperature); and discussed the relationships between the ENSO and climate change. The main findings of this study were (1) during the period of 1961–2015, annual precipitation and temperature generally increased at a rate of 2.68 mm/year and 0.16 °C/10a, respectively; (2) the precipitation temporal trends have significant spatial differences. For example, the high precipitation increasing rates occurred in northern Jiangxi province in summer, while the large decreasing rates happened in most regions of Jiangxi province in spring; (3) an abrupt temperature change was detected around 1984, with general decreasing trends and increasing trends in 1961–1984 and 1984–2015, respectively; (4) ENSO had significant impacts on precipitation changes over Jiangxi province, for example; the El Niño events, beginning in April and May, were likely to enlarge the amounts of precipitation in the following summer, and the El Niño events beginning in October were likely to enlarge the precipitation amounts in the following spring and summer; and (5) the El Niño events, starting in the second half of the year, were likely to raise the temperature in the winter and the following spring. These findings would provide valuable information for better understanding the climate change issues over Jiangxi province.},

Near-real-time (NRT) satellite precipitation products are attractive to rainstorm monitoring and flood warning guidance owing to its combination of timeliness, high spatiotemporal resolution, and broad coverage. We evaluate the performance of four NRT satellite products, i.e., Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks, 3B42RT, Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) NRT, and Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) Late run using a high-quality merged product in the rainy June over South China. In addition, a method based on an empirical flash flood guidance and the Flash Flood Potential Index is proposed to examine the applicability of satellite products in guiding flood warning. The IMERG Late run and GSMaP NRT perform the closest-to-ground observations. 3B42RT detects the most flood warning events due to its notable overestimation of actual precipitation. We recommend that the IMERG Late run is the best NRT satellite product in capturing flood hazard events according to the Pareto Efficiency of jointly optimizing higher hit ratio and lower false alarms.},
